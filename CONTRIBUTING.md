## Commit Messages
Clearly documenting your commits helps us keep the project history clean and easy to navigate. 
To document your commits effectively, we ask that you adhere to the following guidelines:

### Commit Title 
The title of your commit should clearly express the feature or fix that the commit adds. 
Be concise and specific. An example of a good commit title is:

    "Add: Reallocate Memory Feature to the Memory Module"

Try to avoid generic commit titles like "Updated files" or "Minor fixes". 
The goal of the title is to give a clear indication of the content and purpose of the commit.

## Pull Requests

Your Pull Requests play a crucial part in the development of this Project, 
and we appreciate the time and effort you put into them.

To ensure clarity and to facilitate the review process, we have a specific format for PR titles and descriptions:

### PR Title
The title of your Pull Request should clearly indicate what issue it resolves or what it adds 
if it is not related to an existing issue. Be concise and specific. Examples of good PR titles are:

- "Fixes #123: Corrects Null Pointer Exception in Login Function"
- "Adds: New Logging Functionality to Improve Debugging"

The use of "Fixes #issue_number"  or "Adds" in your title helps us identify what the PR is related to quickly.

### PR Description
The description should provide a brief overview of the changes you have made and the reason behind them. 
Detail what you have changed, why you changed it, and what impact it will have on the project. 
This will help the reviewers understand your thought process and review your PR accurately.

Keep in mind to be descriptive yet succinct, and feel free to use bullet points to outline your changes. 
Here is a suggested template for your PR description:

    "<Short introduction about the module/function affected and the main change>
    
     Detailed explanation of the important parts of the commit,
     focusing on the reasons behind the change and what they mean
     for the project. Try to group related changes, and clearly
     differentiate between different changes made in the commit.>"

Following these guidelines will help us maintain a clean, well-documented project history. 
Thank you for your contribution!
